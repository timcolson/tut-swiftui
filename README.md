# Apple Tutorial on SwiftUI (tut-swiftui)

2021-01 : TimC worked thru the Official [Apple Swift UI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui), finishing on 2021-02-04! ðŸ¥³

This repository tracks the code from beginning to end, but does not 100% match Apple. 
Included are some of my experiments, minor UI tweaks, and extra notes/comments for my future-self and others.

I also made copious notes in a Dropbox Paper Doc; shared with a few others who are working thru the tutorial. 

If you'd like to join that group, please reach out to me.

## Positives

* A **lot** of SwiftUI concepts packed into a concise tutorial!
* Documentation and web-based presentation are elegant and helpful. 
* Instructions are generally easy to follow. 
* The code all works!

### Negatives

* Some of the sections, especially near the end, were perhaps too dense. 
* Assumption seems to be that audience has previuos iOS/UiKit experience, and quite a bit of Swift too.
* A few sections were not explained in detail, so I spent extra time researching to understand the concepts better.
* Apples time estimate of 4 hours 25 min seem overly optimistic. (Many sections took me easily 5x to 10x longer.)   

## TL;DR Summary

I **highly recommend** this tutorial for developers new to SwiftUI, or simply interested in iOS/MacOS/WatchOS development. 

By the end of the tutorial, you'll gain basic knowledge of SwiftUI components, layouts, integration with UIKit, and data handling technigues.
The project shows how to share components & views between iOS (iPhone/iPad), WatchOS, and MacOS. 

The final applications show it is possible to build professional-looking mobile & desktop apps in the Apple ecosystem, and it's fun too!
